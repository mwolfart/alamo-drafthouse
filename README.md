## Implementation details

This project was developed using Angular 12, as well as some additional frameworks
- Axios, for retrieval of data
- Angular Materials, for displaying grid-like structure
- Prettier, for padronization of the code

Additional information on development:
- There is a variables css file, to store theme variables such as colors and fonts.
- Futura PT was not used, as it is not free. Instead, we use Didact Gothic, a font provided by Google Fonts, which is very similar.
- All icons were exported from Figma, in order to avoid using extra third party packages and to be closer to the original design.
- Some effects were added to the items in order to provide a more natural feeling for the application.
- Application is also responsive and works in mobile platforms.
- An extra description was added to any theaters that do not contain movies being displayed.

We hope you enjoy reviewing this work!
